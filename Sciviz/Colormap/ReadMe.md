### Sciviz using colormap:

We have tried to analyze the **Hurricane Katrina** , a deadly tropical cyclone that struck the southeastern United States in late August 2005. The hurricane and its aftermath claimed more than 1,800 lives, and it ranked as the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. We have sampled 7 days over the period of August and September 2005 .This specific time frame was chosen to visualize the impact of this Hurricane , which struck the Gulf Coast of United States between August 25th and August 31, 2005.

We have analyzed this hurricane using colormaps. Detailed analysis is given in the report.
